    "Addressing dimensions and slices by name instead of index makes code a lot more readable. This feature also exists in other frameworks to some extent but remains largely unused due to requiring more code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These additions make it possible for UnifyML to take care of reshaping operations under-the-hood.\n",
    "Another consequence is that the order of dimensions is irrelevant and operations such as [`stack`](https://holl-.github.io/UnifyML/unifyml/math/#unifyml.math.stack) do not require an index argument."

    "* Slicing by name is a lot more readable, e.g. `image.channels['red']` vs `image[:, :, :, 0]`.\n",

    "* You can have arbitrarily many batch dimensions (or none) and your code will work the same.\n",
